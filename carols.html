    <h2>Silent night</h2>
    <p>
      Silent night, holy night!<br />
      Sleeps the world; hid from sight,<br />
      Mary and Joseph in stable bare<br />
      Watch o'er the Child beloved and fair,<br />
      Sleeping in heavenly rest,<br />
      Sleeping in heavenly rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent night, holy night!<br />
      Shepherds first saw the light,<br />
      Heard resounding clear and long,<br />
      Far and near, the angel-song:<br />
      'Christ the Redeemer is here,<br />
      Christ the Redeemer is here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent night, holy night!<br />
      Son of God, O how bright<br />
      Love is smiling from Thy face!<br />
      Strikes for us now the hour of grace,<br />
      Saviour, since Thou art born,<br />
      Saviour, since Thou art born.
    </p>

    <h2>Once in royal David's city</h2>
    <p>
      Once, in royal David's city,<br />
      Stood a lowly cattle shed,<br />
      Where a mother laid her baby<br />
      In a manger for His bed.<br />
      Mary was that mother mild,<br />
      Jesus Christ, her little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came down to earth from heaven,<br />
      Who is God and Lord of all,<br />
      And His shelter was a stable,<br />
      And His cradle was a stall:<br />
      With the poor and meek and lowly<br />
      Lived on earth our Saviour holy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And through all His wondrous childhood<br />
      He would honour and obey,<br />
      Love and watch the lowly mother<br />
      In whose gentle arms He lay.<br />
      Christian children all should be<br />
      Mild, obedient, good as He.
    </p>
    <p>
      For He is our childhood's pattern:<br />
      Day by day like us He grew;<br />
      He was little, weak and helpless;<br />
      Tears and smiles like us He knew:<br />
      And He feeleth for our sadness,<br />
      And He shareth in our gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And our eyes at last shall see Him<br />
      Through His own redeeming love;<br />
      For that child, so dear and gentle,<br />
      Is our Lord in heaven above;<br />
      And He leads His children on<br />
      To the place where He is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in that poor lowly stable,<br />
      With the oxen standing by,<br />
      We shall see Him, but in heaven,<br />
      Set at God's right hand on high;<br />
      When like stars His children crowned,<br />
      All in white shall wait around.
    </p>

      The wonders of His love,<br />
      The wonders of His love,<br />
      The wonders, the wonders of His love.
